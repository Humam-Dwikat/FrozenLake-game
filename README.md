# FrozenLake-game
  FrozenLake-game is a Python implementation of the FrozenLake environment in OpenAI's Gym, demonstrating how to apply Reinforcement Learning (RL) using Q-Learning.

### About This Project
  This project explores the challenges of training an agent in the FrozenLake environment, specifically addressing the reward structure that affects training efficiency.

### Proposed Solution
  To improve training efficiency:
    - The agent will receive a small reward for each step taken while on Frozen (F).
    -A discount factor will be applied to encourage the agent to reach the final goal as soon as possible.
### Features
  -Implemented a Q-Learning algorithm for reinforcement learning in Python.
